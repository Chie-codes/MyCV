  <!-- About Me -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I have a strong STEM background with A-Levels in Maths, Biology, and Chemistry, which equipped me with analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. My passion for innovation led me into software development, where I enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp to gain hands-on training in Python, Django, and web development. Through projects completed during and after the bootcamp, I have developed practical experience in building applications that are both functional and user-focused.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my time as <strong>Student President at Harrow College</strong>, I gained valuable experience in teamwork, communication, and responsibility. This role taught me the importance of listening to others, being adaptable, and working with people from different backgrounds, skills that continue to guide me in both my technical and personal growth. I also founded <strong>Girl Code Diaries</strong>, an initiative that encourages girls to explore STEM and technology, which has deepened my appreciation for mentorship and collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am eager to continue learning, contribute effectively within a team, and grow as a software engineer. My goal is to combine technical skills with curiosity and creativity to deliver meaningful solutions.
